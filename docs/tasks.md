# QA Tasks – Buggy Product Form

## Task 1: Find the Bugs (Functional & Non-Functional)

Explore the "Buggy Product Form" to your left. Identify as many bugs as you can.  
Include functional (e.g., "price doesn't update"), non-functional (e.g., "bad on mobile," "hard for screen readers"), and visual bugs — anything that is not described in PRD as desired behaviour or is against the QA principles.

## Task 2: Write Test Cases only for the Discount Code feature

Write a set of positive and negative test cases. Focus on clarity — no need to write comprehensive test cases. Imagine this as a checklist.

## Task 3: Automation & Selectors

Imagine you need to automate a test for this form.  
The id, class, and data-qa attributes are dynamic and change on every page load (their prefix, e.g., el-xyz-123, is randomized).  

Write stable, understandable, resilient, clean CSS or XPath selectors for the following elements:

- The "Quantity" input field  
- The "Apply Discount" button  
- The "Total Price" text (the $ amount)  
- The "Priority Shipping" radio button
